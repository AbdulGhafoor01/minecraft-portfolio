    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Netriccraft (2018) - Second Developer (Admin Rank)</h3>
    <p>I joined during its second season after playing in Season 1. I was tasked with building the entire Survival game mode including permissions, world configuration, and plugin integration. The server had ~100 concurrent players and ranked #2 on a major Indian voting site. It shut down abruptly without community notice.</p>

    <h3>BeSmarter (2019â€“2022) - Owner & Developer</h3>
    <p>I developed and maintained all aspects of the server, reaching #1 in Pakistan. Featured creative systems like a Brain Refresh command, Boss Arena, Battle Pass, and hosted multiple game modes and mini-games. The server shut down due to hosting limitations after years of consistent growth.</p>

    <h3>McMatrix (2024) - Owner & Developer</h3>
    <p>A rebranded version of BeSmarter after 3 years. Reached #1 again in Pakistan. Included new features like Easter Eggs, Gadget Menu, PvP Arena, and an RP Rank Point system using CMI in Bedwars. Upgraded for version 1.21 and reused BeSmarter's Discord with 500+ members.</p>
